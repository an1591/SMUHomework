objects 
df - initial dataframe before scrubbing of 2016 birthname data
badname = list of names which met the criteria needing to be filtered
y2016 = post-filtering 2016 dataset
y2015 = 2015 dataset
total = merges 2015 & 2016 dataset
test = vector of row number indices used to id the names to be filtered from df
final = post-merge dataframe
biggest subset of final containing the names with > 30,000 occurances
female dataframe containing only females named occurances
top10girls dataframe containing the top 10 female occurances


Variables
names/name -  name bestowed
gender - gender of child to whom the name was bestowed
n = number of times the name was bestowed a child of the particular gender
total = sum of n2016 & n2015
n2015 - number of named occurances in 2015
n2016 number of named occurances in 2016
gender.x - system created after merger of 2015 and 2016 data
gender.y - system created after merger of 2015 and 2016 data
top10girls = top 10 most bestowed girls names
gender.y - system created after merger of 2015 and 2016

procedure:
read 2016 datafile
filter the data
read the 2015 data
merge the datasets by name
calculate the total (n2016 + 2015)
id the most popular names (> 30k total)
sort the final data set in descending order of total
id those values > 30K
id the top 10 names
subset the data into a dataframe containing only females
sort the female dataset by descending total
id the top 10 names
write out the top 10 names to a csv file
